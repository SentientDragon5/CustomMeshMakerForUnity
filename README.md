# CustomMeshMakerForUnity
A small script that can create either custom meshes or polygons
To use simply add to a unity scene on a gameobject with mesh filter and Renderer.
You can assign the verticies and the triangles from the script to create a custom mesh.
The polygon Script will create a polygon with a center point. 
The polygon Script will average all the points to create a center point, then reorder the points
in clockwise order to create an upward facing mesh from the points you give it.
see my custom water mesh repository to see an application of this.
